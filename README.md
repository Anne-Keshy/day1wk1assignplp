Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.	Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to the design ,development, testing and maintenance of software systems.
It is crucial in the technology industry as it enables the creation of reliable, efficient and maintainable software products that meet the user needs.

2.	Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a.the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference, which recognized software engineering as a distinct field.
b.the development of the waterfall methodology in the 1970s, which introduced a structured approach to software development
c.the Agile Manifest in 2001, which emphasized flexibility and iterative development.
3.	List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning, where requirements are gathered and a project plan is created 
Analysis, where requirements are analyzed and a detailed design is created
Design, where software architecture and user interface are designed
Implementation, where the software is coded
Testing, where the software is tested for defects
Deployment, where the software is released to production 
Maintenance, where software is updated and supported
4.	Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall technology is a linear approach where each phase is completed before moving on the next one while The Agile is an iterative approach where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and self-organizing cross-functional teams.
Waterfall is suitable for projects with well defined requirements and fixed timeline like project to develop a safety critical system such as a medical device while Agile is suitable for projects with uncertain or changing requirements like project to develop a mobile app.
5.	Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    	Software developer is responsible for designing, coding , testing and maintaining software application 
Quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring software meets requirements and is free from defects.
Project manager is responsible for planning , organizing and controlling software development projects.
6.	Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a comprehensive set of tools for coding, debugging and testing, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency.
Example of IDEs include Eclipse, Visual Studio and NetBeans
VCS enable multiple developers to collaborate on a project by tracking changes to the codebase, managing different versions and facilitating concurrent development.
Example of VCS include Git, Subversion, 	Mercurial and Perforce.
7.	What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing complexity, meeting tight deadlines, ensuring code quality and communicating effectively with stakeholders.
Strategies include breaking down complex systems into smaller modules, ranking tasks, conducting code reviews and wring unit test and using clear and concise language and actively seeking feedback and clarification from stakeholders
8.	Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual units of code as functions or methods to ensure they behave as expected and produce the expected and produce the correct output.
Integration testing involves testing how different units of code interact with each other to ensure they work together seamlessly and produce the expected output.
System testing involves testing the entire software system to ensure it meets the requirements and works as expected in different scenarios and environments.
Acceptance testing involves testing software system to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria and requirements defined by stakeholders and that it is ready for deployment

 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1.	Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is process of designing and optimizing text prompts to effectively interact with AI models.
It involves crafting clear, specific and concise input to elicit desired responses, improve model performance and achieve better outcomes.
The importance lies in ability to significantly impact the quality and relevance of AI-generated output.
2.	Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
	Vague Prompt: I want to go on a vacation.
	Improved Prompt: I am looking for a 3-day summer vacation in Maldives, preferably in a coastal city with a budget of $3,000 per person, including flights and accommodation. Please suggest three options with their pros and cons.
	The improved prompt is more effective because it provides specific details about the vacation such as duration, destination, budget and preferences.
